# Phase 1: Batch Tracking Foundation - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: What We're Doing

This is **Phase 1** of a multi-phase transformation. We're implementing the **minimum viable batch tracking** without breaking your existing system.

### What Gets Added:
1. ✅ `suppliers` table
2. ✅ `product_variants` table (simplified - one variant per product initially)
3. ✅ `inventory_batches` table
4. ✅ Auto-migration of existing products

### What Stays The Same:
- ✅ Existing `products` table (enhanced, not replaced)
- ✅ Existing `inventory` table (now aggregate view)
- ✅ All existing features work
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### Migration Strategy:
```
For each existing product:
1. Keep product as-is
2. Create ONE default variant (same name, prices, etc.)
3. If has inventory, create ONE batch with current stock
4. Link everything properly
```

### After Migration:
- Old functionality: ✅ Still works
- New functionality: ✅ Can track batches
- Sales: ✅ Now deduct from batches (FIFO)
- Inventory: ✅ Shows batch-level detail

## 🚀 Next Steps After This Completes

Once Phase 1 is stable:
- Phase 2: Add LIFO/FEFO allocation
- Phase 3: Full PO system  
- Phase 4: Multi-variant products UI
- Phase 5: Advanced reporting

**For now, focus on getting Phase 1 working!**
