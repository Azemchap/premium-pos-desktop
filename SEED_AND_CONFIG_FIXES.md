# Seed Files, Config & Dashboard Fixes - Complete

## Summary
All seed files, app configuration, and Dashboard page have been checked and fixed. All errors have been resolved.

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Seed Files - Tax Rate Format** ✅
**Problem**: Both seed files were storing `tax_rate` as percentage values (8.5, 6.5) instead of decimal format (0.085, 0.065).

**Files Fixed**:
- `src-tauri/src/seeder.rs` - Line 75
- `src-tauri/src/seeder_building_materials.rs` - Line 110

**Changes Made**:
```rust
// BEFORE (seeder.rs)
tax_rate: 8.5  // ❌ Wrong: percentage format

// AFTER
tax_rate: 0.085  // ✅ Correct: decimal format (8.5%)
```

```rust
// BEFORE (seeder_building_materials.rs)
tax_rate: 6.5  // ❌ Wrong: percentage format

// AFTER
tax_rate: 0.065  // ✅ Correct: decimal format (6.5%)
```

**Impact**: Tax calculations will now be correct across the application.

---

### 2. **Seed Files - Removed Invalid Timezone Field** ✅
**Problem**: `seeder.rs` was trying to insert a `timezone` field that doesn't exist in the database schema (it was removed in migration v6).

**Files Fixed**:
- `src-tauri/src/seeder.rs` - Line 75

**Changes Made**:
```rust
// BEFORE
INSERT INTO locations (..., tax_rate, currency, timezone)
VALUES (..., 8.5, 'USD', 'America/New_York')  // ❌ timezone doesn't exist

// AFTER
INSERT INTO locations (..., tax_rate, currency)
VALUES (..., 0.085, 'USD')  // ✅ Removed timezone
```

**Note**: `seeder_building_materials.rs` already had timezone removed, so no change needed there.

---

### 3. **Dashboard - StoreConfig Interface Update** ✅
**Problem**: The `StoreConfig` interface was missing several fields that exist in the database schema.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Lines 36-47

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// BEFORE
interface StoreConfig {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    address?: string;
    phone?: string;
    email?: string;
    tax_rate: number;
    currency: string;
    timezone: string;  // ❌ Doesn't exist in DB
    created_at: string;
    updated_at: string;
    // ❌ Missing: city, state, zip_code, logo_url
}

// AFTER
interface StoreConfig {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    address?: string;
    city?: string;          // ✅ Added
    state?: string;         // ✅ Added
    zip_code?: string;      // ✅ Added
    phone?: string;
    email?: string;
    tax_rate: number;
    currency: string;
    logo_url?: string;      // ✅ Added (supports store logo feature)
    created_at: string;
    updated_at: string;
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Dashboard can now properly display store logo
- Full address information is now available
- No TypeScript errors when accessing these fields

---

### 4. **Default Database Config Enhancement** ✅
**Problem**: Default store configuration was missing city, state, and zip_code fields.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src-tauri/src/database.rs` - Line 242

**Changes Made**:
```sql
-- BEFORE
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO locations (id, name, address, phone, email, tax_rate, currency)
VALUES (1, 'ZTAD POS', '123 Main Street', '+1-555-0123', 'info@ztadpos.com', 0.08, 'USD');

-- AFTER
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO locations (id, name, address, city, state, zip_code, phone, email, tax_rate, currency)
VALUES (1, 'ZTAD POS', '123 Main Street', 'New York', 'NY', '10001', '+1-555-0123', 'info@ztadpos.com', 0.08, 'USD');
```

**Impact**: New installations will have complete default store configuration.

---

## Database Schema Verification

### Locations Table Structure ✅
```sql
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    state TEXT,
    zip_code TEXT,
    phone TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    tax_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.0,      -- Stored as decimal (0.08 = 8%)
    currency TEXT DEFAULT 'USD',
    logo_url TEXT,                   -- Added in migration v7
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Points**:
- ✅ No `timezone` field (removed in v6)
- ✅ `tax_rate` is REAL type, stored as decimal
- ✅ `logo_url` field exists (added in v7)
- ✅ All address fields present

---

## Tax Rate Format Standard

**Correct Format**: Decimal (0.085 for 8.5%)

**Why**: 
- Database stores as REAL/float
- Calculations use decimal format
- Display multiplies by 100 for percentage

**Examples**:
```
Database: 0.085  →  Display: 8.5%
Database: 0.065  →  Display: 6.5%
Database: 0.08   →  Display: 8.0%
```

---

## Settings Store Verification ✅

Checked `src/store/settingsStore.ts`:
- ✅ All preferences properly typed
- ✅ Default values sensible
- ✅ Persist middleware configured
- ✅ Helper functions for appearance/sounds

**No changes needed** - already well-structured.

---

## Tauri Configuration Verification ✅

Checked `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`:
- ✅ App name: "ZTAD POS"
- ✅ Window sizing appropriate
- ✅ Asset protocol configured for logo access
- ✅ Bundle configuration complete

**No changes needed** - configuration is correct.

---

## Linter Verification ✅

Ran linter checks on all modified files:
```bash
✅ src/pages/Dashboard.tsx - No errors
✅ src-tauri/src/seeder.rs - No errors
✅ src-tauri/src/seeder_building_materials.rs - No errors
```

---

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Seed Files
```bash
# Delete existing database and re-seed
rm -rf ~/.local/share/com.ztadpos.app/pos.db
cargo tauri dev
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Store config has correct tax rate (8.5% or 6.5%)
- ✅ No timezone-related errors
- ✅ All products seeded successfully

### 2. Test Dashboard
- ✅ Store name displays correctly
- ✅ Tax rate shows as percentage (e.g., "8.5%")
- ✅ Address fields populate if present
- ✅ Logo can be uploaded and displays

### 3. Test Tax Calculations
- ✅ Create a sale with taxable items
- ✅ Verify tax amount is calculated correctly
- ✅ Check receipt shows proper tax breakdown

2. **Tax Rate Settings UI**
   - Add ability to change tax rate through Settings
   - Validate range (0-100%)

3. **Multiple Location Support** (Future)
   - Currently supports single location (id=1)
   - Could expand to support multiple stores

4. **Timezone Support** (Future)
   - If needed, can be re-added with proper UI
   - Would require new migration
