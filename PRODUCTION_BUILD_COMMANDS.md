# 📦 Production Build - Ready to Deploy

## 🎉 Your Android App is Working!

Now that your app is tested and working on the emulator,
here's how to build it for production and distribution.

---

## 🚀 **Production APK Build:**

### **1. Stop Development Build:**
In your terminal, press **Ctrl+C** to stop the dev server.

### **2. Build Production APK:**
```bash
pnpm android:build
```

**What happens:**
- Builds optimized release version
- Minimizes and compresses code
- Signs the APK
- Creates universal APK (works on all devices)

**Build time:** ~2-5 minutes

**Output Location:**
```
src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release.apk
```

**APK Size:** ~15-25 MB (approximately)

---

## 📱 **Install Production APK:**

### **On Emulator:**
```bash
adb install src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release.apk
```

### **On Real Device:**
1. Copy APK to device
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Settings
3. Tap APK file to install
4. Open app and test

---

## 🏪 **Google Play Store Build:**

### **Build AAB (App Bundle):**
```bash
pnpm android:build:aab
```

**Output Location:**
```
src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/universalRelease/app-universal-release.aab
```

**Then:**
1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Create new app
3. Upload AAB file
4. Fill in app details
5. Submit for review
6. Publish to Play Store!

---

## 🔐 **Signing (For Production):**

For production builds, you should use your own signing key:

### **Generate Signing Key:**
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore premium-pos.keystore -alias premium-pos -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### **Configure in tauri.conf.json:**
```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "android": {
      "minSdkVersion": 24,
      "versionCode": 1,
      "keystorePath": "../premium-pos.keystore",
      "keystorePassword": "your-password",
      "keyAlias": "premium-pos",
      "keyPassword": "your-password"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 📊 **Version Management:**

### **Update Version:**

**In `tauri.conf.json`:**
```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",  // Change to 0.2.0, etc.
  "bundle": {
    "android": {
      "versionCode": 1  // Increment for each release (2, 3, 4...)
    }
  }
}
```

**In `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`:**
```toml
[package]
version = "0.1.0"  // Keep in sync with tauri.conf.json
```

## 🧪 **Testing Before Production:**

### **Checklist:**
- [ ] Test on multiple Android versions (7.0+)
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test all features thoroughly
- [ ] Check database persistence (restart app)
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Verify all 12 pages work
- [ ] Test login/logout
- [ ] Test sales creation
- [ ] Test inventory updates
- [ ] Verify reports accuracy

## 📦 **Distribution Options:**

### **1. Direct Distribution (APK):**

- Users install via "Unknown Sources"
- Good for: Internal testing, beta users, custom deployments

### **2. Google Play Store (AAB):**
- Professional distribution
- Automatic updates
- Larger audience reach
- Good for: Public release, commercial apps

### **3. Enterprise Distribution:**
- Internal company app store
- MDM (Mobile Device Management)
- Good for: Company-specific deployments
