# Database Seeding Guide

## üå± Automatic Seeding

The database is **automatically seeded** when you first run the application. The seeding process:
- Runs only once (checks if data already exists)
- Creates sample data for testing and demonstration
- Is completely safe and non-destructive

```bash
# Delete the database and restart the app
pnpm reset-db
pnpm tauri:dev
```

### Method 2: Manual deletion
1. Stop the application
2. Delete the database file:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\com.premiumpos.Premium POS\pos.db`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.premiumpos.Premium POS/pos.db`
   - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/com.premiumpos.Premium POS/pos.db`
3. Restart the application

### Method 3: Development mode
Delete `src-tauri/target/debug/pos.db` and restart

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Seeding Works

The seeding process is defined in `src-tauri/src/seeder.rs` and:

1. **Checks for existing data**: Won't duplicate if products already exist
2. **Creates users** with hashed passwords
3. **Creates store configuration**
4. **Creates products** with realistic data
5. **Creates inventory records** for each product
6. **Creates sample sales** with proper accounting
7. **Updates stock levels** based on sales

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Non-destructive**: Won't delete existing data
- **Transactional**: Either completes fully or rolls back
- **Logged**: Progress messages in console
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles failures

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Seeding doesn't run
- Check console for "üå± Starting database seeding..." message
- Ensure database file has write permissions
- Check for error messages in terminal

### Partial seeding
- Application may have stopped mid-seed
- Delete database and try again
- Check disk space

### Duplicate data
- Seeder checks for existing products
- Only runs if fewer than 10 products exist
- Won't create duplicate users with same username

## üìö Additional Resources

- See `APP_FEATURES.md` for complete feature list
- Check `src-tauri/src/seeder.rs` for implementation
- Review database schema in `src-tauri/src/database.rs`

**Note**: The seed data is for **development and demonstration purposes**. For production use, you should:
1. Delete all seed data
2. Create your actual products
3. Set up your real users
4. Configure your store information
5. Start processing real transactions

The seeding system makes it easy to get started and test the application with realistic data!
