  - Get item count for badge display

### 2. **Dedicated Cart Page** (`src/pages/Cart.tsx`)

  - Display all cart items with quantity controls
  - Increase/decrease quantities
  - Remove individual items
  - Clear entire cart
  - Customer information form
  - Payment processing
  - Sale completion modal with receipt printing
  - Order summary sidebar

### 3. **Navigation Integration**
- **Cart Icon in Top Nav Bar**:
  - Positioned next to notification bell icon
  - Shows badge with item count
  - Animates when items are present
  - Clicking navigates to `/cart` page

### 4. **Sales Page Updates**
- Integrated with global cart store
- Cart state persists when navigating away
- Users can add items, then navigate to `/cart` to complete purchase
- Removed local cart state in favor of global store

## 📍 Files Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `src/store/cartStore.ts` - Global cart state management
2. `src/pages/Cart.tsx` - Dedicated cart/checkout page

### Modified Files:

   - Added cart icon button to top navigation
   - Imported and used cart store for item count

2. `src/App.tsx`

## 🛒 User Flow

### Adding Items to Cart:
1. User browses products on `/sales` page
2. Clicks on a product to add to cart
3. Cart icon badge updates in real-time
4. Items are stored in localStorage (persist across sessions)

### Completing a Sale:
**Option 1: From Sales Page**
- User can still complete sale directly from sales page (existing flow)

**Option 2: From Cart Page (New)**
1. Click cart icon in top navigation
2. Review items in cart
3. Adjust quantities or remove items as needed
4. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
5. Enter customer information (optional)

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Cart Icon Badge:
- **Empty cart**: Gray icon
- **Items in cart**: Primary color with pulse animation
- **Badge**: Shows item count (or "99+" if > 99)
- **Animation**: Ping effect on badge

### Cart Page:
- **Responsive layout**: 2-column on desktop, stacked on mobile
- **Real-time calculations**: Subtotal, tax, and total update instantly
- **Stock validation**: Prevents adding more than available stock
- **Empty state**: Helpful message with "Start Shopping" button
- **Confirmation dialogs**: For clearing cart and completing sale

## 🔒 Data Persistence

Cart data is persisted in **localStorage** using Zustand's persist middleware:
- Survives page refreshes
- Survives app restarts
- Automatically synchronized across tabs
- Storage key: `cart-storage`

---

## 🚀 Benefits

   - Can review cart before completing purchase
   - Cart persists across navigation

2. **Mobile-Friendly**:

   - Can modify cart at any time before checkout
   - Clear visual feedback on cart status

4. **Maintainability**:
   - Single source of truth for cart state
   - Reusable cart logic across components
   - Type-safe with TypeScript
