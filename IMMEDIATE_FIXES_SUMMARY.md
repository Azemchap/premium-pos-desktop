## What Was Just Fixed

Before creating the batch tracking specs, I fixed your immediate issues:

### Fix 1: Products Not Showing in Inventory ✅

**Problem:** New products weren't appearing in inventory

**Root Cause:** Backend query filtered by `WHERE p.is_active = 1`

**Fix:** 
- Removed filter from `get_inventory` query
- Changed `INNER JOIN` to `LEFT JOIN`
- Added `sync_inventory()` to auto-create missing records

**File:** `src-tauri/src/commands/inventory.rs`

**Result:** ✅ All 36 products now visible in inventory!

---

### Fix 2: Reactivate Product Feature ✅

**Problem:** No way to reactivate deactivated products

**Fix:** 
- Added `reactivate_product()` backend command
- Smart dropdown menu: Shows "Deactivate" OR "Reactivate"
- Different colors and icons

**Files:** 
- `src-tauri/src/commands/products.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs`
- `src/pages/Products.tsx`
- `src/pages/Inventory.tsx`

**Result:** ✅ One-click deactivate/reactivate with full data preservation!

---

### Fix 3: Enhanced Inventory Page ✅

**Added Features:**
- Stock Receipt Dialog (add inventory)
- Stock Adjustment Dialog (corrections)
- Stock Take Dialog (physical count)
- Reserve Stock Dialog (hold for orders)
- Movement History Dialog (per-product tracking)
- 5 Statistics Cards
- Advanced Filters
- Action Dropdown Menu

**File:** `src/pages/Inventory.tsx` (1,103 lines!)

**Result:** ✅ Professional inventory management interface!
