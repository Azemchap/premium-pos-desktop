# ✅ INVENTORY & PRODUCTS - ALL ISSUES FIXED

## 🎯 YOUR ORIGINAL ISSUES

### Issue 1: "New products aren't showing in inventory"
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

**Root Cause:** Backend query filtered products with `WHERE p.is_active = 1`

**Solution:** Removed the filter - now shows ALL products regardless of status

### Issue 2: "Need reactivate button for products"
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Solution:** 
- Added `reactivate_product` backend command
- Smart dropdown menu that shows:
  - **Deactivate** (red) for active products
  - **Reactivate** (green) for inactive products

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL CHANGES

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `src-tauri/src/commands/inventory.rs`
```rust
// BEFORE (Line 37)
WHERE p.is_active = 1  // ❌ Filtered out inactive products

// AFTER
// No WHERE clause - shows ALL products ✅
```

#### 2. `src-tauri/src/commands/products.rs`
```rust
// NEW FUNCTION ADDED
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn reactivate_product(
    pool: State<'_, SqlitePool>, 
    product_id: i64
) -> Result<bool, String> {
    let result = sqlx::query("UPDATE products SET is_active = 1 WHERE id = ?")
        .bind(product_id)
        .execute(pool.inner())
        .await
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    Ok(result.rows_affected() > 0)
}
```

#### 3. `src-tauri/src/main.rs`
```rust
// ADDED TO INVOKE HANDLER
commands::products::reactivate_product,
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. `src/pages/Products.tsx`

**Added reactivate handler:**
```typescript
const handleReactivateProduct = async (productId: number, productName: string) => {
  if (!confirm(`Are you sure you want to reactivate "${productName}"?`)) return;

  try {
    await invoke("reactivate_product", { productId });
    toast.success(`Product "${productName}" reactivated successfully!`);
    loadProducts();
    loadMasterData();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to reactivate product:", error);
    toast.error(`Failed to reactivate product: ${error}`);
  }
};
```

**Updated dropdown menu:**
```tsx
{product.is_active ? (
  <DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => handleDeleteProduct(product.id, product.name)}>
    <XCircle className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
    Deactivate
  </DropdownMenuItem>
) : (
  <DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => handleReactivateProduct(product.id, product.name)}>
    <CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
    Reactivate
  </DropdownMenuItem>
)}
```

#### 2. `src/pages/Inventory.tsx`

**Enhanced status display:**
```tsx
<TableCell>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-1">
    <Badge>{status.label}</Badge>  {/* Stock status */}
    {!item.product?.is_active && (
      <Badge variant="outline" className="text-red-600">
        Inactive Product
      </Badge>
    )}
  </div>
</TableCell>
```
