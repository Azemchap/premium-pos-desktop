# 🔧 Fix Cargo Version Issue

## ❌ Error:
```
error: failed to parse manifest at base64ct-1.8.0/Cargo.toml
feature `edition2024` is required
The package requires the Cargo feature called `edition2024`, but that feature is 
not stabilized in this version of Cargo (1.82.0).
```

## ✅ Solution: Update Rust/Cargo

Your Cargo version (1.82.0) is slightly outdated. Update to the latest stable:

### **Quick Fix:**
```bash
rustup update stable
```

This will update:
- Rust compiler
- Cargo
- All toolchains

### **After Update, Run:**
```bash
# Verify new version
cargo --version

# Should show 1.83.0 or newer

# Then try Android build again:
cargo tauri android dev
```

---

## 🎯 Alternative: Simplify & Build

If you don't want to update Rust right now, we can try building without checking first:

```bash
# Skip cargo check, go straight to Android build
# Tauri will use its own build process
cargo tauri android dev
```

The Android build process might handle dependencies differently and work anyway.

## 📝 Recommended Steps:

1. **Update Rust (Best Option):**
   ```bash
   rustup update stable
   cargo tauri android dev
   ```

2. **Or Try Direct Build:**
   ```bash
   cargo tauri android dev
   ```

One of these should work!
